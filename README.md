# CS-255

I approached the DriverPass project with a methodical mindset, considering myself part of a small consulting firm responsible for both software and hardware solutions. The project manager brought DriverPass on board to help students prepare for driving exams with behind-the-wheel instruction and online practice tests. A key requirement was ensuring the system had the latest training and rules in line with the local DMV. Important features included push alerts, cross-platform compatibility, and a scheduling system for students to book time with instructors.

I believe I performed well overall, though I could improve my understanding of user needs and how to incorporate them fully. Going back to refine user interfaces and ensuring non-functional requirements are met would be my focus. It might be helpful to engage with the customer or review transcripts of conversations to better understand their goals. Additionally, gaining insight into the perspectives of the production team would enhance the design process.

My strategy involved explaining everything clearly and logically, concentrating on the user, administrator, and staff experiences. I work best in an incremental approach, keeping everything clean and organized, which helps me stay focused and assess my progress when revisiting the project after time away.
